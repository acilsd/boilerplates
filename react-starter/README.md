##Simple React-Webpack boilerplate

My own hand-made noilerplate :3
If something works just fine why would you complicate it?

---
### Whats inside:

*  React
*  Redux
*  React-router
*  Webpack
*  One-file prod'n'dev config
*  Unit tests (deprecated and deleted for now)

Nope, this does not include any linters scripts, you can use your own (im using one built in my IDE)
---

### How can i make this work?

*  `npm install`
*  `npm run wds`
*  `npm build`
*  `npm test` (deleted for now)

---

### Future improvements:

*  Migrate to Webpack 2
*  Swith to yarn for fuk sake (im too lazy, yep)
*  React-router v4
*  React-hot-loader v3
*  Tree-shaking and lazy loading
*  Proper setup for testing
