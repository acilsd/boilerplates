##Simple React-Webpack boilerplate

My own hand-made boilerplate :3
If something works just fine why would you complicate it?

---
### Whats inside:

*  React
*  Flow
*  Redux
*  React-router
*  Webpack 3???
*  React-router v4
*  React-hot-loader v3
---

### How can i make this work?

*  `npm install`
*  `npm run wds`
*  `npm build`

---

### Important note:

Flow should be integrated in your IDE / TE of choice (check Nuclide (Atom) as the simpliest yet very powerful example). I'm too lazy to implement proper webpack / script flow-setup;

### Important note#2:

No css! I moved all my projects to css-in-js (styled-components, emotionjs). For proper setup of css/csspreprops/postcss webpack-loaders please check Webpack' official documentation (do not forget to install required packages, huh);
