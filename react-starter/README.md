##Simple React-Webpack boilerplate

My own hand-made boilerplate :3
If something works just fine why would you complicate it?

---
### Whats inside:

*  React
*  Redux
*  React-router
*  Webpack 2
*  React-router v4
*  React-hot-loader v3
*  One-file prod'n'dev config
*  Unit tests (deprecated and deleted for now)

---

### How can i make this work?

*  `npm install`
*  `npm run wds`
*  `npm build`

---

### Future improvements:

*  Switch to yarn for fuk sake (im too lazy, yep)
*  Proper setup for testing
